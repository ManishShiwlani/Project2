Binary Search implementation in C++

The code executes following commands


Find movie : find a movie. Your program should prompt the user and get the title and search
the tree.
Find person: find a person. Your program should prompt the user and get the personâ€™s name
and then search the tree for any people that match the name given.
Delete movie: delete a move from the movie tree -- the movie should be input using the title.
Delete Person: Delete a person from the person tree. The person should be entered by name.
Add Movie : Add a new movie to the tree.
Add Person : Add a new person to the tree.
List Movies : List all the movies in the tree.
List People : List all the people in the tree.
Exit : save the tree containing the movies and the tree containing the people to files and exit the
program.


Movies and People are built into two separate binary search trees.
Key for the movie is the title of the movie.
Key for the people is the name.
